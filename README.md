readSensors - Humidity-, Temperature-, PH-, Flow, Pressure- and Moisture-Sensor



Introduction:

Different Sensors are read with directly calculation
of default Electronic-Hardware for a couple automation tasks

Most sensors are analog sensor and have to be connected trought the AD-Converter with the Raspberry-Pi
or if u use an arduino u have to connect them to the analog inputs

There is also a logic programmed to use the sensor with different warning and error levels
For initiation of the ph-sensor please read the documentation

Feel free to add other sensors to this library
